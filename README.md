# Hereos Of Herp Derp

### IMPORTANT NOTE!
This project has been discontinued due to a multitude of reasons, chiefly project scope, budget and some inherit design flaws that prevent me from making this game truely great. This was the first solo project i worked on that was scoped for over a year, and as such, the experience of taking on such a large project by myself has taught me many great lessons about software development that i couldn't have learnt from my CS degree. The game will be still be available for download/playing at Itch.io.

The good news: this project has had an identity crisis, and is now being redesigned as a card battler game.

### About the game
Developed using the Unity Engine, 'Hereos Of Herp Derp' is a 2D, Roguelike adventure game reminiscent of titles like 'Dungeons And Dragons', 'Slay The Spire' and 'Divinity 2: Original Sin'. This project is currently my main focus.
